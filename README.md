# Tata iQ – Online Retail Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project was created as part of a data visualization task where I analyzed an online retail dataset using Power BI. The goal was to answer strategic questions posed by the CEO and CMO of the company related to revenue trends, customer behavior, product demand, and market performance.

## 🎯 Business Questions Answered

1. **CEO**: What are the seasonal trends in revenue for 2011 (monthly)?
2. **CMO**: Which are the top 10 countries (excluding UK) by revenue and quantity sold?
3. **CMO**: Who are the top 10 customers by revenue?
4. **CEO**: Which countries (excluding UK) show the highest product demand?

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned by applying:
- A filter to exclude transactions where **Quantity < 1** (to remove returns or incorrect data)
- A filter to remove entries with **UnitPrice < 0** (to remove data input errors)

This ensured only valid sales data was used.

## 📈 Power BI Features Used
- Time-series line charts
- Bar and column visuals
- Slicers and filtering
- Clean, professional layout across 4 tabs (1 per question)

## 🗂 Report Tabs
| Tab Name | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `Q1_Revenue_2011` | Monthly revenue trends |
| `Q2_Top_Countries` | Top 10 countries by revenue & quantity (excluding UK) |
| `Q3_Top_Customers` | Top 10 customers by revenue |
| `Q4_Country_Demand` | Global demand (excluding UK) |
