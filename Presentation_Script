Final Presentation Script (For Power BI Video – 5 Minutes)

1. 👋 Introduction (0:00–0:30)
“Hello, I’m [Your Name], and I’m excited to present key insights from our online retail data, answering four key business questions asked by the CEO and CMO.

Before diving into the dashboards, I’d like to quickly walk through the data preparation process I followed to ensure accurate and actionable insights.”

2. 🧹 Data Cleaning Summary (0:30–1:00)
“Upon loading the dataset into Power BI, I applied two critical data checks:

First, I filtered out any records where the quantity was below 1, to exclude returns or data entry errors.

Second, I removed rows where the unit price was negative, as these represented incorrect entries.

This ensured that the analysis reflects only genuine, valid transactions — providing a reliable base for decision-making.”

3. 📊 Q1 – CEO: Revenue Trends in 2011 (1:00–1:30)
“On the first tab, I’ve created a monthly time series chart for revenue in 2011.

This chart highlights seasonal patterns — for instance, we see revenue spikes around November and December, likely due to holiday shopping surges, and lower revenue in early months like February.

This information can help forecast future seasonal demand, guide inventory stocking, and shape promotional strategies at the right times.”

4. 🌍 Q2 – CMO: Top 10 Countries by Revenue & Quantity (1:30–2:00)
“On the second tab, we focus on the top 10 countries (excluding the UK) that generated the highest revenue.

I’ve created a combined bar chart showing both revenue and quantity sold side by side.
Notably, countries like Netherlands, Germany, and France show strong performance both in volume and revenue.

These insights can help the CMO prioritize top-performing international markets and plan regional marketing campaigns accordingly.”

5. 👥 Q3 – CMO: Top 10 Customers by Revenue (2:00–2:30)
“On the third tab, I’ve built a descending bar chart that highlights the top 10 revenue-generating customers, starting with the highest at the left.

This visual quickly surfaces our most valuable customers, allowing the CMO to target them with loyalty programs, exclusive deals, or personalized offers to maintain and grow their business with us.”

6. 🌐 Q4 – CEO: Product Demand Across Countries (2:30–3:00)
“Finally, on the fourth tab, we look at global product demand, excluding the United Kingdom.

To fulfill the CEO’s request for a single-glance view without scrolling or hovering, I used a sorted bar chart showing total quantity sold by country.

Countries like Netherlands, EIRE (Ireland), and Germany stand out with consistently high demand — making them prime candidates for expansion strategies.”

7. 🧠 Strategic Summary (3:00–4:30)
“To summarize:

The 2011 monthly revenue trend reveals seasonal behaviors we can leverage in planning.

Our top 10 international markets are clear candidates for campaign investments.

We’ve identified our top 10 high-value customers, crucial for retention efforts.

Lastly, the demand heatmap by country helps prioritize global expansion outside the UK.

All visuals are clean, easy to interpret, and built on valid data after thorough preprocessing.”

8. 🙏 Closing (4:30–5:00)
“Thank you for the opportunity to analyze this data. I’m confident that these insights can help guide both marketing and strategic growth decisions.
